# Module Description
# ------------------
#
#
# Open GUI-based Emacs from the current directory in the background
# so we can continue using the shell.
#
# Pass to emacs:
#   - --chdir to the current working directory so we open the same files
#     as what is specified on the command line. If we don't do that the GUI
#     based Emacs might use a different directory (I saw that it uses the home
#     directory) and if you specify files that are not in that directory they
#     will not be opened, another file file open which will most likely be
#     in an empty buffer (if the file does not exists in the home directory).
#   - All script command line arguments
#
# Note: Some versions of Emacs for macOS graphical dumps an error when it starts.
#       This is annoying; it's noise on the shell.
#       Just mask it by dumping it in the bit bucket.
#
# Emacs 27+ support:
#    - To allow Emacs early-init.el code to distinguish whether Emacs is
#      running in terminal mode or in graphics mode.  When running
#           early-init.el Emacs does not know and the function
#           display-graphic-p does not work at that moment.  The only way I
#           have found is to use an environment variable.  So the following
#           code sets one up: PEL_EMACS_IN_GRAPHICS
#
# See: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/66268/how-to-set-package-user-dir-with-emacs-27-with-package-quickstart-and-distinguis
