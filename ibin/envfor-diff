# Module Description
# ------------------
#
# The USRHOME system provides the ability to pre-select one of several diff
# programs for doing a file diff.  By default the /usr/bin/diff program is used.
# But you can change that by executing the 'use-diff', sourced by this file,
# to select another program.
#
# This sets the USRHOME_DIFF environment variable to a value that the script
# usrhome/bin/diff uses.  When USRHOME is used, that directory is located in
# the path before the /usr/bin directory, so the script will take over.
#
# If USRHOME_DIFF is not defined, the script defaults to /usr/bin/diff,
# otherwise it uses the program identified by the value stored inside
# USRHOME_DIFF.
#
# All of the programs supported accept 2 file names.
# The USRHOME diff script passes the arguments to the program actually used,
# and in some cases re-organizes them to adapt to the program being used.
# This is quite useful in case of Subversion diff requirements for instance.
# It's also useful when using other tools such as Beyond Compare.

Usage: use-diff PROGRAM_NICKNAME

Supported PROGRAM_NICKNAME:
  - diff            : The default.  Use /usr/bin/diff.
  - diff-u          : Use /usr/bin/diff -u
  - bcomp           : Use Beyond Compare launcher
  - bcompare        : Use Beyond Compare main application.
  - svndiff-diff    : Use diff, but expect arguments provided by svndiff.
  - svndiff-bcomp   : Use bcomp, but expect arguments provided by svndiff.
  - svndiff-bcompare: Use bcompare, but expect arguments provided by svndiff.
