ps-erlang -- Print information about all Erlang process running in a terminal.

 Usage: ps-erlang -h | --help

  • Print this help information.

 Usage: ps-erlang [PATTERN]

  • Print information about all Erlang processes running in a terminal.

      Print a line for each Erlang process.
      Each line contains the following columns.
      All columns are lined up except the last one since
      the command may be short or long.

         UID  : user ID
         PID  : process ID
         PPID : Parent process ID
         C    : CPU utilization of process or thread
         STIME: system CPU time
         TTY  : controlling terminal
         TIME : total CPU time (user + system) since it started
         CMD  : erlang command
         Separator: ▶︎▶︎▶︎ CWD:
         CWD:  Current working directory of the Erlang process

      The CWD information is only printed when the GNU AWK is available.

    - If PATTERN is specified, filter the result with an extra grep filter
      using that pattern.  That can be used to search for an Erlang process
      launched under a specific command, or using a specific working directory.
      It can also be used to specify another Erlang-based language like elixir
      or lfe.

    The exit code is 0 if at least one Erlang process was found, 1 otherwise.
