# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Module Description
# ------------------
#
# Filter script: formats each line from stdin.
# The lines are expected to be audit log lines.


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dependencies
# ------------
#
# - GNU awk
# - The file $USRHOME_DIR/bin/other/ausyscall-lookup.awk must have been
#   created on a Linux system and copied manually into place.  That file
#   is created by running the ausyscall utility that is only available on Linux.

au-format: Reformat audit lines (similar to var/log/audit/audit.log):
           - Change time to human readable format.
           - Replace syscall numbers by their function name.
           - Improve line up my using fixed size for record type name.
           - Unless --line-oriented is specified:
             - Prefix each line with a record number

 Usage:  au-format [--line-oriented]
         au-format -h|--help

This is a file-oriented filter by default.

To process each line separately, as required for a filter
used with 'tail -f' you must specify the --line-oriented option.
