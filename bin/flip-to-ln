# Description
# -----------
#
# This utility moves a file from its original location into a new location,
# and then creates a symbolic link from the old location to the new location.
#
# For example:
#
#  - `flip-to-ln ~/.emacs.d/init.el  ~/my/depots/emacs.d/`
#
#    - moves             ~/.emacs.d/init.el   TO   ~/my/depots/emacs.d/init.el
#    - creates a symlink ~/.emacs.d/init.el  ----> ~/my/depots/emacs.d/init.el
#
# It prints what it did.
#
#  Exit codes:
#   - 0 : on success
#   - 1 : command line error
#   - 2 : operation error; nothing has been modified.
#
#
# BUGS:
#  - Limitation: the created symbolic link is absolute on macOS
#                but it is relative on Linux where the GNU coreutils ln (>= 8.16)
#                has the -r option to create relative links even when the
#                arguments are absolute.

Usage: flip-to-ln FILENAME DIRNAME
        - Move FILENAME inside directory DIRNAME
        - Create a symlink at FILENAME pointing to it's new location inside DIRNAME

       If FILENAME is already a symlink, the command warns and
       return exit code 2.

  Exit codes:  0 : on success
            :  1 : command line error, usage is printed.
            :  2 : execution error.  Nothing is done.

- Limitation: the created symbolic link is absolute on macOS
              unless the arguments are relative paths.
              The symlink created on Linux is always relative if it can be
              since the code takes advantage of the GNU coreutils ln (>= 8.16)
              has the -r option to create relative links even when the
              arguments are absolute.
