    # Subversion support.
    # Subversion diff is a special case: subversion itself
    # launches the diff program passing 7 arguments to the utility.
    # The argument that subversion provides to the diff uitility
    # program it uses are:
    # - Arg 1:  option : -u
    # - Arg 2:  option : -L
    # - Arg 3:  Path and revision of the first file/revision
    # - Arg 4:  option : -L
    # - Arg 5:  Path and revision of the second file/revision
    # - Arg 6:  Dirpath of the first file to compare
    # - Arg 7:  Dirpath of the second file to compare
    #
    # Therefore the important arguments are 6 & 7 for the files to compare
    # and 3 & 5 to display the file names and their revisions.

 The diff command is currently controlled by USRHOME use-diff.
 With it, the USRHOME_DIFF environment variable identifies the
 actual program to use.
 This is currently set to the unknown value of '$USRHOME_DIFF'.
 Either execute use-diff again or do a clrenv USRHOME_DIFF
 to fall back to use the standard diff command.
