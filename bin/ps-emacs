# Module Description
# ------------------
#
# Print information about all Emacs processes running.
# For those inside a terminal window, identify the terminal as nicely as
# possible.  List the Emacs processes not running inside a terminal window
# after the list of Emacs running inside a terminal window.

ps-emacs -- Print information about all Emacs processes.
            List Emacs processes running in terminal windows first, identify
            the terminal as nicely as possible for those.
            List other Emacs processes after.

 Usage: ps-emacs -h | --help

  • Print this help information.

 Usage: ps-emacs [PATTERN]

  • Print information about all running Emacs processes.

      Print a line for each Emacs process.
      Each line contains the following columns.
      All columns are lined up except the last one since
      the command may be short or long.

         UID  : user ID
         PID  : process ID
         PPID : Parent process ID
         C    : CPU utilization of process or thread
         STIME: system CPU time
         TTY  : controlling terminal
         TIME : total CPU time (user + system) since it started
         CMD  : emacs command
         CWD:  Current working directory of the Emacs process

      The CWD information is only printed when the GNU AWK is available.

    - If PATTERN is specified, filter the result with an extra grep filter
      using that pattern.  That can be used to search for an Emacs process
      launched under a specific command, or using a specific working directory.

    The exit code is 0 if at least one Emacs process was found, 1 otherwise.
