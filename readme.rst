.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

USRHOME is a starting project with the goal of holding a set of portable
Unix shell configuration files that can be used in macOS and multiple Linux
distributions.  At first it will support Bash and the Z shell.

The intent is not to provide colourful configurations with fancy fonts and
emoji but allow its use in:

- the default macOS Terminal.app,
- the default Linux terminal applications,
- inside Emacs various terminal shell modes,

and work well when used with my `Pragmatic Emacs Library`_ which provides
extensive key bindings for use in these Operating systems and allow extended
use of the `numeric keypad`_.

In this early version of USRHOME I focus on macOS zsh and make several
assumptions as to where some files and directories are located. As USRHOME
evolves, I will add support for Bash on macOS and Linux and then complete zsh
support for Linux.
Also I'm going to make USRHOME more configurable and flexible.
At this very early stage USRHOME is not very flexible.  However, this
constitutes a set of shell configuration files I can use in multiple
computers.

It specifically assumes that:

- The directory that holds the USRHOME directory tree also holds
  a directory tree called ``usrcfg`` that holds the user-specific
  and private configuration information.
  See `The zsh User Configuration File`_ table.
- Emacs is used, the terminal Emacs is the EDITOR.
- 3 directory trees are managed by USRHOME: *~/my/dv*, *~/my/dvpub* and *~/my/dvpriv*.

How to Set it Up
================

- Clone the USRHOME repository somewhere on your home directory tree.
- Create a ``usrcfg`` directory inside the same directory that holds the
  ``usrhome`` directory.

  - Create the ``usrcfg/setfor-zsh-config.zsh`` file.  That file will be
    sourced during the Z Shell startup by ``~/.zprofile``.  Inside that file
    export one or several of the environment variables described in
    `The zsh User Configuration File`_ table.

- Save your shell user configuration files that exist in USRHOME.
- Create symbolic links from your home directory to the corresponding USRHOME
  files listed in the table below.
- Place your original logic not present in USRHOME inside the user-specific
  and user-private scripts USRHOME uses (*more on this later*).

Command and Script Organization
-------------------------------

USRHOME provides several types of command and scripts, as listed here.

============================= ================== =================================================
Name format of scripts        Type of script     Purpose
============================= ================== =================================================
``USRHOME/bin/do-CMD``        Sourced script     Meant to be invoked by alias command ``CMD``
``USRHOME/bin/setfor-CMD``    Sourced script     Meant to be invoked by alias command ``CMD``
``USRHOME/bin/envfor-ENV``    Sourced script     Meant to be invoked by alias command ``use-ENV``
``USRHOME/bin/...``           Shell script       A regular script that can be invoked directly.
============================= ================== =================================================

The commands alias are all sourcing a sourced script that *injects* or *modifies*
something inside the current running shell.  The source scripts all have names
that start with one of the identified prefixes: ``setfor-`` or ``envfor-``.

The ``setfor-`` sourced scripts are used by various USRHOME commands that
control the shell, such as ``usrhome-shell-toggle-tracing`` and
``usrhome-prompt-toggle-usr-host``.

The ``envfor-ENV`` sourced scripts are used by the equivalent ``use-ENV``
command.  These commands set the shell for the environment identified by the
``ENV`` suffix.  The idea is that when you start a shell it comes with a
minimal environment.  You can then activate a given environment by issuing the
corresponding ``use-`` command.  For example, assuming that you want to use
various tools for the Erlang, Factor, Rust or Zig programming languages but
separately, in each shells, you would use the ``use-erlang``, ``use-factor``,
``use-rust`` and ``use-zig`` commands that source their corresponding source
scripts that update the PATH and other environment variables that are
necessary for the environment.

As USRHOME grows, I will be adding several of these environment setting
scripts and commands to support various Operating Systems.
