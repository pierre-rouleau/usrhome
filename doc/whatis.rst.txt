Support for whatis utility
--------------------------

The whatis utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several tools, including Emacs, take advantage of the Unix `whatis utility`_.
With ``whatis`` you can query the list of topics available in the various ``man``
pages installed in your system.  Here's a session using ``whatis`` to get man
topics about ``man`` and ``whatis``:

.. code:: sh

    zsh% whatis emacs
    emacs(1)                 - GNU project Emacs editor
    emacsclient(1)           - tells a running Emacs to visit a file
    etags(1), ctags(1)       - generate tag file for Emacs, vi
    changelog(n), doctools::changelog(n) - Processing text in Emacs ChangeLog format
    mg(1)                    - emacs-like text editor
    changelog(n), doctools::changelog(n) - Processing text in Emacs ChangeLog format
    mg(1)                    - emacs-like text editor

The ``whatis`` utility uses a whatis file.  On most Unix-like systems, the man
page directory contains the whatis file.

Some packages do not have the appropriate whatis file.  That file must be
built independently.
