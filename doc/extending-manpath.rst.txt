Introduction - Problem, Challenge and Solution
==============================================


**The Problem**:

Having installed a new software package you notice that the ``man`` command
does not find information for the commands in this package.  You know where
the man files are stored and you want them used by ``man``.

**The Challenge**:

As this is USRHOME, I'd like the solution to work in all operating systems
supported by USRHOME, which is macOS and all distributions of Linux.

Looking at the man pages of ``man`` and ``manpath`` from several system we
can see that under Linux the file ``~/.manpath`` can be used to set the
configuration for ``man``.  This file is not supported on macOS.

**The Solution**

As always in USRHOME, the solution is to use the environment variables, along
with setup source scripts.   The various shell specializing scripts can extend
the value of MANPATH if it is already set.  If it is not set then it must be
set to the value returned by the ``manpath`` command.    On some system, like
Linux, the ``manpath`` command supports the ``-g`` option which provides a
longer list of directories.

Therefore the sh-specific logic that must be used in various shell
specialization sourced script that must support all the target environments
must be the following, included inside the usrhome/ibin/extend-manpath:

.. code:: sh

          if [ -z "$MANPATH" ]; then
              if manpath -g > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                  MANPATH="$(manpath -g)"
              else
                  MANPATH="$(manpath)"
              fi
              export MANPATH
          fi

The `USRHOME_DIR/ibin/do-extend-manpath`_ script also provides the ability to
extend the MANPATH by adding directories before and/or after the list of
directories in MANPATH.  To do that set the ':' separated directory paths into
the following variables:

======================= ===================================================
Variable Name           PURPOSE
======================= ===================================================
MANPATH_EXTRA_BEFORE    List of ':' separated directories that are placed
                        **before** the directories of MANPATH.

MANPATH_EXTRA_AFTER     List of ':' separated directories that are placed
                        **after** the directories of MANPATH.
======================= ===================================================

Therefore, to add extra directories to MANPATH inside a Bash shell of one of
your systems, you could write the following code inside your local
configuration file for Bash``$USRHOME_DIR_USRCFG/do-user-bashrc.bash``:

The shell extending source script can then do the following:

.. code:: sh

          MANPATH_EXTRA_BEFORE="$HOME/my-prioritized-pages/share/man"
          MANPATH_EXTRA_AFTER="$HOME/tool-a/share/man:$HOME/tool-b/share/man"
          MANPATH_SHOW_IF_MODIFIED=true
          . "$USRHOME_DIR/ibin/do-extend-manpath"

The script exports the new value of MANPATH and prints a line showing that
MANPATH was modified (with instructions to use ``showpath MAN`` to display it)
if the MANPATH_SHOW_IF_MODIFIED variable is set to "true" as shown above.
